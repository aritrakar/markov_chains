# Markov Chain Implementation

This repository contains the code for a **finite-state discrete time Markov chain** implementation in **C++** using the **Eigen** library. It's a work in progress and serves to complement my learnings in my stochastic processes class (STAT 333: Stochastic Processes 1).

Note that the files for Eigen were not uploaded.

**Current capabilities:**

1. Simulate $n$ steps of the Markov chain.
1. Find communication classes.
1. Find the steady state.
1. Find the periodicity of states.

## Prerequisites

1. C++17
1. Eigen (see [here](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/GettingStarted.html))
